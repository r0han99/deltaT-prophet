# Historical Data Analysis & Prediction of Change in Temperature **(Î”T)** in Major Cities
***


_Abstract: Forecasting the Long-term global warming rate is significant in a variety of fields, including climate research, agriculture, energy, medicine, and many more. This is project show cases detailed analysis of the change in temperatures for different countries. Challenge dwells on creating a reliable, efficient statistically reliable model on large data set and accurately capture relationship between average annual temperature. This data will be used as the foundational information to train multiple machine learning models with approaches like Deep Neural Networks and LSTMs, Time series forecasting algorithms like FbProphet and fine-tune the best working approach out of the lot to get accurate generalisations. Obtaining this analysed and forecasted data ahead of time allows the use of long-term mitigation methods._
